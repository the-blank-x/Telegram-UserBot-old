# Telegram-UserBot 

Just coz I'm too lazy, I program it, to make stuff easier.
This is a userbot, which is equivalent to a telegram client, and it can run on the cloud too.
It needs a linux pc or any unix to run basic commands, or you need to find the workaround yourself :/

### Before you start:
Get your api-id(API_KEY in my code), API_HASH from my.telegram.org.<br/><br/>
Create an empty group, add marie, or any of its clone, find group id, then copy it and this is your LOGGER<br/><br/>
**Please read through this before cloning. I don't want you get stuck anywhere. This guide can get you running up the userbot, if followed properly**

#### Running on heroku:
```diff
-If you clone/fork this repo please make sure you generate a session file  by running app.py on your local pc before deploying it on heroku.

- If you get errors like -->app[worker.1]: telethon.errors.rpcerrorlist.AuthKeyDuplicatedError: An auth key with the same ID was already generated, 

- It means your session was banned and needs to be regenerated.
```

- Fork my repo.

- Download/Clone it in your linux PC, then follow instructions on Running on linux(below), this will generate a session_name.session file, which is needed to run your bot, push this file to your git.
